## About Me

Hello! I'm Bhavan Sai, a dedicated DevOps Engineer with a background as a  Full Stack Developer. I have a passion for creating efficient and scalable infrastructure, automating processes, and optimizing software delivery pipelines. My goal is to bridge the gap between development and operations to ensure seamless collaboration and smooth application deployment.

In my previous role as a Full Stack Developer, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing web applications. This experience has given me valuable insights into the software development lifecycle and has deepened my understanding of both frontend and backend technologies.

As a DevOps Engineer, I excel in building and managing cloud infrastructure using tools like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. I am proficient in containerization technologies such as Docker and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. I have expertise in configuration management tools like Ansible, infrastructure-as-code using Terraform, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD.
<!-- 
I am an advocate for automation, aiming to streamline development processes and improve efficiency through the use of tools like Git, GitLab, or GitHub Actions for version control and CI/CD workflows. I am also experienced in monitoring and logging systems such as ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and Prometheus. -->

I constantly strive to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry best practices through continuous learning and participation in online communities. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams, sharing knowledge, and solving complex problems.
